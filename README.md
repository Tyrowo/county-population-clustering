Hello! 
If you just want to see the results of the experiment, I recommend downloading the "RESULTS - Plotting K-Means Model Results.ipynb" file and opening it in Google Colab
https://colab.research.google.com/
It has a lot of interactive models for you to play with to really get a feel for what happened with the model.

You're welcome to run through any of the other ipnyb files too if you want to see the process of building the K-Means clustering model. I've left them full of notes from my thought process along the way, and with the print statements that happened from running everything. 
They are all set to download the data where I've hosted it the files on my personal portfolio so you can repeat the experiment yourself, although I do not recommend it because building the model took about 4 hours. And finding the best seeds took about that much time as well.
The data files are also available on the data prepping project that preceeded this, at https://github.com/Tyrowo/us-county-data-processing-and-visualization
