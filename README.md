Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my project.

If you just want the simplest way to to see the results of the experiment, I recommend 
opening this link to my public copy of "RESULTS - Plotting K-Means Model Results.ipynb" on Google Colab:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vNBWcvx-enUxJCj5XizBani4VQFCTVO9?usp=sharing


In Colab click File -> Save A Copy In Drive
This will copy all of the cells to your own personal copy. Click the top cell (where it says import..., import...) and click Ctrl/Command + Enter until you go all the way to the bottom.
It has a lot of interactive models for you to play with to really get a feel for what happened with the model.
However, the sliders for the interactive models don't work on MY personal copy, so copying to your own drive and running the code will enable you to play with the models.


You're welcome to run through any of the other ipnyb files too if you want to see the process of building the K-Means clustering model. I've left them full of notes from my thought process along the way, and with the print statements that happened from running everything. 
They are all set to download the data where I've hosted it the files on my personal portfolio so you can repeat the experiment yourself, although I do not recommend it because building the model took about 4 hours. And finding the best seeds took about that much time as well.
The data files are also available on the data prepping project that preceeded this, at https://github.com/Tyrowo/us-county-data-processing-and-visualization
